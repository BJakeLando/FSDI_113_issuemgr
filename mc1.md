# Mini Challenge 1

### Create the initial version of our new issue tracking app.

The issue tracker should cover at least these requirements:
1. There must be a home page that explains what our software product is and what it does.
2. There must be an about page that explains who we are (as developers or a fictitious company)
3. It should be possible to create new issues (which should be set to "to do" by default -- not started)
4. It should be possible to update issues so that they are marked as "in progress" or "done" as needed.
5. Issues should, at a minimum, contain the following fields or attributes:
5.1. Summary (a title containing a summary of the issue)
5.2. Description (a large text field that allows for further clarification of the issue)
5.3. A status ("to do", "in progress" or "done" -- "to do" by default for new issues)
5.4. A priority ("low", "medium" and "high")
5.5. A reporter (the creating user)
5.6. An assignee (must be a "user" type)
